# Assist project of Professor Ansari - 3D Metal Printer Error Detection

Working with Dr. Muhammad Ansari on developing an algorithm model designed to automatically detect errors and halt the printing process of a 3D metal printer.

My primary focus involves processing image labels using Connected Components Analysis. The dataset consists of images of metal blocks, with the goal of labeling the pores ("bubbles") that appear during the printing process.

These bubbles result from a chemical reaction due to incorrect temperature and other parameters, leading to the formation of large holes in the metal blocks. This compromises their structural integrity, making them brittle and unstable, necessitating the cessation of the printing process to minimize costs.
